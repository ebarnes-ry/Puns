    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Domain-Specific Area \n",
    "\n",
    "Punning is a form of wordplay in which a word is used in a way such that it holds multiple meanings simultaneously, phonetic similarities, or syntactic structures to purposefully introduce ambiguity to express (an often humorous) idea (Miller et al., 2017). The detection and \"disambiguation\" of puns pose significant challenges in natural language processing (NLP) through the inherent importance of context, semantics, and morphological nuance that is often entirely resistent to traditional quantification methods. The task itself of pun detection lies at the crux of of subjective interpretation and semantic disambiguation, making it a valuable and interesting testbed for evaluating models that aim to capture meaning from subjective language. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fascinating problem space in itself, and because it not only seeks to improve machine interpretation capabilities for practical purposes - notably machine translation and summarization tasks - but to understand humor and the ways humans convey and interpret meaning. Researchers in linguistics, cognitive psychology, and literary studies have long researched humor and wordplay, and more specifically puns, for their unique applications (Monnot, 1982; Culler, 1988; Lagerwerf, 2002; Bell et al., 2011; Bekinschtein et al., 2011; Delabastita, 1997). Machine translation and, more specifically, humor translation has been an area of minimal research until the popularization of machine learning and AI-driven language interpretation research that opened new scopes that overcame many of the percieved limitations that hindered evaluation. Despite the vast improvements made by transformer models in the area of meaning representation/mapping, a 2018 study by Li et al. showcased how machine translation models struggle and often fail to detect puns specifically, leading to loss of meaning and misinterpretation in translated text (Li et al., 2018). Previous pun detection efforts have historically framed the task as a binary classification problem (pun vs. no pun). While some classical methods relying on handcrafted features that capture phonetic and semantic ambiguity have been attempted, modern approaches largely lean toward leveraging deep embeddings - transformers, contextual word embeddings - to disambiguate text (Popova et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, puns tend to exploit multiple meanings in language, making them an ideal domain to test a model's ability to handle ambiguous and subtle linguistic phenomena. Applying the results of this task to real-world scenarios like preserving humor and nuance across languages as they are machine translated, automatic curation or generation of headlines to be used by creative industries, and more natural human-computer interactive conversation agents that are capable of recognizing jokes and puns, would both practically improve the scope of these domains and open new spaces for research in adjacent areas (irony detection, sentiment analysis, etc.). By focusing on pun detection, this project provides a comparative lens through which to see how statistical and embedding-based models handle subjective, context-dependent linguistic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This report aims to compare how effectively traditional statistical models and embedding-based models, two fundamentally different approaches to text classification, detect and interpret the existence of puns in text. This will be a uniquely challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity of puns, but will also offer a stringent test for each model's ability to capture meaning which in turn offers insight into the trade-offs of each model type in handling linguistic ambiguity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of both models will be evaluated using standard metrics - accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score - on both homographic puns where the same word has multiple meanings (e.g. \"The fisherman was hooked\"), and heterographic puns that focus on phonetic similarities between words creating ambiguity (e.g. \"I told a chemistry joke, but there was no reaction\"). Another dimension this project aims to explore is the role of feature engineering and embedding learning. As mentioned, these are approaches grounded in different assumptions and encapsulates the strength that characterises each text classification approach. Logistic regression and handcrafted features geared toward addressing the challenges faced in the past by statistical models, and the SimpleT5 embedding model with task-specific fine-tuning that showcases the strengths of neural representaitons allow for a comprehensive comparison on these bases. \n",
    "\n",
    "A topic becoming of more relevance in many related (and unrelated) domains with the popularization of ML in everyday life is interpretability. As Miller (2017), a prominent figure in literature review for this project, defines it, \"Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision\", and, at times, this is just as important as something being correct to the impact of a result (Miller, 2017). It's worth noting the transparency logistic regression provides with its specific feature association, and the black-box nature of models relying on complex neural representaitons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this initial experiment will contribute to broader NLP research and linguistic research as a whole by presenting confirmed results for each model on the task of pun detection that inadvertently showcase the things that drive the ability to interpret puns, and subsequently other subjective language applications. More directly we will demonstrate the limitations of statistical models in handling non-linear linguistic phenomena, and showcase how embedding-based models excel at context-dependent tasks. This framework for comparing statistical and embedding-based approaches in subjectivity-oriented text classification tasks can be applied to humor detection, irony detection, and sarcasm recognition in future expansion. \n"

    "The dataset selected for this pun detection classification task is the SemEval 2017 Task 7 Dataset which was specifically designed for a shared task on pun detection and interpretation (Miller T. et al., 2017). It's a widely recognized benchmark set in NLP for evaluating systems on their ability to handle linguistic ambiguity and wordplay, and is grounded on a problem-space specification paper published by the Ubiquious Knowledge Processing Lab and Ontological Semantic Technology Lab included with the dataset (Miller T. et al., 2017). It was the most referenced piece in the literature review conducted in exploration of the problem, and has founded many subtask attempts similar to this one that focus on various areas and niches within pun-detection. \n",

    "The paper and dataset were released as part of the SemEval 2017 workshop, a competitive evaluaiton forum for semantic analysis systems(Miller T. et al., 2017). The dataset, gold labels, and scoring system are made publicly available on the official website (Miller T. et al., 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is structured to support three subtasks, per their README also included...\n",
    "1. Subtask 1: Pun Detection - binary classification of sentences as pun or no pun.\n",
    "2. Subtask 2: Pun Location - identifying exact word or phrase responsible for the pun.\n",
    "3. Subtask 3: Pun Interpretation - referencing back to synset word tags to disambiguate meanings. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fit the constraints and scope of this project, this review will focus exclusively on data from Subtask 1, while attempting to create an infrastructure to accomodate future expansion into including the other two subtasks in the analysis.\n",

    "The set is organized into test and trial subfolders, each containing an XML set of each type of pun - homo and heterographic - for each subtask, and a corresponding .gold file that references each record with a manual labeled binary classification (in the case of Subtask 1). "

While determined a powerful approach, these models often struggled with deliberate ambiguity and overfitting of literal interpretations without going far enough to recognize dual meanings in wordplay(Gepalova, A. et al., 2024). They are also heavily resource dependent, and can be less accessible and computationally expensive to extend to more than one task, and lack interpretability with their opaque predictions.\n",

    "Some of the inspiration for evaluating a logistic regression model came from a supervised pun detection and location disambiguation attempt done by Feng et al. in 2020. Their approach outlined using targeted feature engineering to cover pitfalls of statistical approaches, tracing back the influence of each feature from the results (Fengm J. et al., 2020). There have been other notable attempts to abstract this task statisticaly - starting in 2004, Taylor and Mazlack used N-grams to recognize and locate wordplay (Rayz, J.T. et al., 2004). In 2015 Miller and Gurevuch (2015) theorized on knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to disambiguate the meaning of puns that were identified (Miller T., Gurevuch, 2015). This particular study led to a novel hypothesis on using WSD for pun, and more broadly subjective text, detection - not just interpretation as has been reviewed. Feng (2020) focuses on establishing features that could be of consequence, which inspired the idea that with the right comprehensive \"feature model\", that covers all bases of the challenge, the problem can be translated into one better suited to a statistical model. \n",

    "High Entropy may indicate a word with multiple possible meanings, and flatness (even distribution) may determine that no single sense strongly dominates. These features would complement the more traditional lexical or syntactic features in identifying pun-related ambiguity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the tokenized and stopword-removed sentences which might otherwise skew overlap, would potentially improve sense matching. Lemmatizing for this ensures that context words align with WordNet's sense definitions - which are often in lemma form (Bird, S. NLTK). "

    "#### Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting the literature review for this project, there was an initial idea to use Multinomial Naive Bayes as the statistical model, since it is such a common and effective model to use for text classification tasks. The CLEF 2023 JOKER Task mentioned evaluated MNB as one of the models to test more broadly multilingual pun detection, location, and interpretation (Prnjak A. et al., 2023). It ranked third among other models tested for detection of puns, but was found to fall short in its ability to capture the subtlety and ambiguity of puns as context was more difficult to introduce (Prnjak A., et al., 2023). MNB works well because of its ability to handle discrete data and calculate probability distributions, which suits capturing linguistic patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "MNB is definitely competitive, and has served as a baseline for more complicated specialized embedding approaches, and hybrid or extended MNB implementations (Prnjak A., et al., 2023). In the context of the goal of this project - comparing traditional statistic approaches and embedding-based approaches - having MNB as a baseline clarifies where more tuned methods truly add value. Naive Bayes is one of those classic baselines in text classification research (spam filtering is a pretty famous example), so it's a proven meaningful lower-bound for such a specialized and nuanced text classification task as this one. \n",
    "\n",
    "If my more advanced approach can't outperform, it would suggest that the approach isn't capturing the essential patterns in the pun data better than basic word-frequency signals. If it does outperform, it becomes evidence that advanced features and/or learned embeddings have more predictive power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both MNB and Logistic Regression are considered traditional classifiers. Logistic Regression tends to handle correlated features a bit better and can more seamlessly incorporate numeric features with different baselines. The bag-of-words assumption of MNB that treats features as independent is what I hypothesize as the greatest limiting factor of MNB for subjective interpretation-based tasks. If my logistic regression model outperforms this baseline, it implies syntactic/semantic feature engineering is capturing patterns beyond simple counts. T5 is a deep, transformer-based model that learns the contextual representations of words. Comparing to this baseline would show how the importance of context interpretation in this task."

Tuning of this feature would be required, which is out of the scope of this assessment, but it would make sense to look at a presence indicator, rather than a count. Note that the SemEval dataset used for this project contains sentences with only one (or no) instance of a pun each, and this occurs in an adjective, major verb, or noun (Miller, T. et al. 2017).

The linear assumption that constrains models like this tend to consistently fail to capture intricate linguistic patterns or context-based pun structures, and performance ends up hinging on the comprehensive feature design. From research and the results of this experiment, it seems that this approach consistently hits the upper bound of the lowest class, tending to be outperformed by deeper architectures on tasks such as these.\n",

It has the most coverage, with the only downsides being computational power requirements - especially for more granularity - and lack of transparency into exactly why a pun was detected. The embedding model's ability to capture multi-token semantics and extensively context is what helps it handle ambiguous linguistics structures more effectively."

    "This exploration investigated the use of a logistic regression model that represented an optimized statistical approach, and a SimpleT5 embedding-based model approach for pun detection - a task that inherently requires some sort of handling of linguistic ambiguity. The Multinomial Naive Bayes model sserved as a baseline, offering quick and straightforward bag-of-words perspective, representitive of the general strengths of even very basic statistical models. Each model was evaluated on a prepared dataset (SemEval 2017 Task 7) that featured the dimensions of complexities of puns, including homo and heterographic puns, exposing both models to semantic and phonetic ambiguities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression approach tested demonstrated that well-engineered features that capture as much perspective as possible can achieve a respectable and competitive balance between precision and recall. The limitations its linear assumptions and reliance on manual feature crafting limit both capacity and ability to scale to capture more complex situations. SimpleT5 contrasts this - while requiring greater time and computaitonal resources - excelling in all performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical standpoint, traditional statistical models are attractive for smaller-scale scenarios where interpretability matters and resource constraints might effect the quality of embedding-model predictions. Embedding-based models do great in complex text spaces where higher accuracy and robust context understanding outweigh whatever interpretability or verification concerns that might arise. The work done in this report contributes to the broader domain of subjective text classification by practically exploring how pun-detection can serve as a benchmark for understanding a model or model approach's ability to handle ambiguity and subtlety. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project sets up for an interesting research space and presents the idea of the extent we can use statistical approaches that quantify the subjective qualities of text to allow for recognition of new patterns for analysis, to enhance and even go as far as interpret results of embedding-based neural models. The framework established sets up for this and extension into related text classification tasks such as sarcasm detection or metaphor processing. The core methodology, balancing interpretability, resources, and performance, is transferrable to other problems within this domain, and even other domain-specific areas that could be used as context to explore and be supported by subjective of creative language pattern interpretation.
